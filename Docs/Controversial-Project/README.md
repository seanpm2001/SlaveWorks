## This project may be controversial

I would regard this as one of my top 3 controversial projects, although it shouldn’t be controversial. It is a project that sends a message about the problems of slavery, and a viewpoint of the lives of former slaves, so that their suffering was not entirely in vein. It also needs to be brought up how harsh slavery is, because there are still a lot of people that are part of the lost cause (Confederate states of america supporters) and actual slavery still going on to this day, with at least 10 million slaves worldwide. For example, Barbados still had slavery in its country well over a hundred years after America ended its slavery problem partially, but not fully. There is still underground slavery in America, and some say that a clause on the 13th amendment makes the America prison system a slave system. One of the most notable slave owners I am targeting in this project is Nestlé, as they are the easiest target due to how evil they are, and how a growing movement against them is starting (for context, Nestlé still uses child slaves to harvest cocoa in Africa. It was difficult for me, but I gave up Nestlé entirely from my life, by stopping the consumption of chocolate milk mix and KitKats. I have been boycotting them strongly for months now. This was my first move of activism in the culinary field, my first moves of activism in the fields of computing were much earlier, and it is harder for me to give up culinary choices)
