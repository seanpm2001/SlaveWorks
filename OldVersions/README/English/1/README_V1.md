# Slaveworks
A video game about slavery that aims to preserve and teach of the horrors of slavery, and why it shouldn't be accepted in society (Nestle, and some other companies/countries still do slavery)

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Slaveworks/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

## About

See above. This project is an open source game meant to teach about slavery and showcase the lives of notable slaves.

***

### Placeholder icon

I am currently using an image of a pair of shackles from Wikipedias slavery template. It is still being used as a stock image. It is not the official projectlogo.

***

## Builds

There currently aren't any functional builds of this project.

No other builds listed

## Controversies

### One of the 3 controversial projects

This project is one of the 3 projects I consider to be controversial. The 3 controversial projects are:

1. [Seanpm2001/Slaveworks](https://github.com/Seanpm2001/Slaveworks/)

2. [Seanpm2001/Politics](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Politics/)

3. [Seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_SexualityCenter](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_SexualityCenter/)

This project serves a purpose, and shouldn't be controversial. The issue of slavery still needs to be solved, because as of July 4th 2021, there are still over 10-100 million slaves worldwide, it just isn't as obvious to spot. Even the United States has slavery still, it didn't completely end with the Civil War.

### Original 2 branches

I was working on the project originally and decided to have a branch called Slaveworks Plantation Branch. On July 2nd 2021, I changed the default branch back to main, and gave this message:

I would regard this as one of my top 3 controversial projects, although it shouldn‚Äôt be controversial. It is a project that sends a message about the problems of slavery, and a viewpoint of the lives of former slaves, so that their suffering was not entirely in vein. It also needs to be brought up how harsh slavery is, because there are still a lot of people that are part of the lost cause (Confederate states of america supporters) and actual slavery still going on to this day, with at least 10 million slaves worldwide. For example, Barbados still had slavery in its country well over a hundred years after America ended its slavery problem partially, but not fully. There is still underground slavery in America, and some say that a clause on the 13th amendment makes the America prison system a slave system. One of the most notable slave owners I am targeting in this project is Nestl√©, as they are the easiest target due to how evil they are, and how a growing movement against them is starting (for context, Nestl√© still uses child slaves to harvest cocoa in Africa. It was difficult for me, but I gave up Nestl√© entirely from my life, by stopping the consumption of chocolate milk mix and KitKats. I have been boycotting them strongly for months now. This was my first move of activism in the culinary field, my first moves of activism in the fields of computing were much earlier, and it is harder for me to give up culinary choices)

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## History

This project was started on May 3rd 2021 as an idea for a game about the horrors of slavery, and the lives of notable slaves, and a recap of historical events leading to the partial abolition of slavery in certain countries and states. I consider this project to be one of my [3 controversial projects](#One-of-the-3-controversial-projects) due to the name alone, although I don't consider it to be bad.

On July 2nd 2021, I changed the main branch back to `main` from the possibly controversial `slaveworks-plantation-branch` which I deemed too inappropriate to keep as the main, but decided to keep it for historical purposes as a stale branch.

The following message is about the projects controversy:

> I would regard this as one of my top 3 controversial projects, although it shouldn‚Äôt be controversial.
