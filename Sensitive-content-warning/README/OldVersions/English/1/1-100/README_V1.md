# Warning

This game may be difficult for some people to play, as it goes over a difficult subject

When I thought of the idea for this game, I went in knowing that slavery is controversial. People seem to think slavery is a thing of the past, but it isn't. There are still child and adult slaves all around the world, as human trafficking is just another word for slavery, and there are still literal slaves being forced to work (notable examples include the Nestlé company, which right now is using child slaves to harvest chocolate. You should boycott Nestlé if you already haven't been doing so)

I am not whitewashing history here. I am making a point for this generation and generations 100 or more years from now that **slavery is not a good thing, never has been a good thing, and never will be a good thing.**

This game aims to pay tribute and honor the suffering of many people who were enslaved, as they shouldn't be forgotten, they were human beings, and likely want their suffering to not go forgotten.

I am also hoping that this game may change the mind of some racidal racist people and get them to agree that forced labor is bad.
